## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor performance throughout and optimize as needed
- **Memory Leaks**: Regular memory usage monitoring and cleanup
- **API Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility until migration is complete

### Schedule Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined phases and defer non-critical features
- **Testing Delays**: Allocate extra time for testing in each phase
- **Integration Issues**: Test integration points early and often

### Rollback Plan
- Keep existing IPC APIs functional throughout migration
- Can revert individual components if issues arise
- Maintain ability to switch back to legacy APIs if needed

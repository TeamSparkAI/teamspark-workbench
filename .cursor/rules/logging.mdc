Use electron-log exclusively for all logging in this project
Never use console.log, console.error, console.warn, or any other console methods
Use appropriate log levels:
log.error() for errors and exceptions
log.warn() for warnings
log.info() for general information
log.debug() for detailed debugging information
This rule ensures consistent logging behavior across both development and production environments, with proper log file management and formatting handled by electron-log.
